# Working with Strings and Regular Expressions

### Setting intent

> Don't ask yourself whether you _can_ do it. Ask yourself if you want to try. If the answer is yes, just do your best - Karolin

This course is hard. Getting stuck is normal. Getting stuck for hours is normal. Part of programming is learning to cope with feelings of being stuck. During the course, you are in a time of transition in your life. It is easy to let the mind wander into questioning your life decisions, especially when you feel stuck/down.

Most of us don't know what the future holds. Worrying about whether in a year or five you'll be one of the best coders in the world and using that to determine whether you should push through, is going to be much harder on yourself that simply asking "Do I want to be here? Do I want to try to get better?"

## Trivia Questions

- Is `'McDonalds'` > `'Burger King'` - true, false or an error? Why?
- What are the differences between a `single quote`, `double quote`, `smart quote`, and `backtick`?
- What is the difference between `a` and `'a'` in JavaScript?

## Main Problem 1

Write a function that determine if a word is a palindrome.

 This prompt is intentionally vague. Be sure to use Polya's method for problem solving to help you figure out how to solve this question. Write down the clarifying questions you have and be ready to discuss them. You can still build a basic solution, even if you would have to refactor it later. 

## Main Problem 2

[Disemvowel Trolls](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52fba66badcd10859f00097e/javascript)

> Trolls are attacking your comment section!
> A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

> Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

> For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".]()
