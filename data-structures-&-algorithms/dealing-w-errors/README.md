# Dealing with Errors

### Setting intent

> I can't do it

> I can't do it, yet

The word `yet` is a powerful word. It changes an absolute thought to a thought that has potential.

When you started this course, if we had asked you to build your last project in the first week, you would not have been able to do it, yet. These last few months have given you an opportunity to grow and it's important to look back and see how far you've come, so that when you do get frustrated, stuck or overwhelmed, you can remember that you can do it, even if you cannot do it, yet.

## Trivia Questions

- What is the difference between a
  - Function declaration
  - Function expression
  - Arrow function
  - Can a function expression be an anonymous function?
  - Can a function declaration be an anonymous function?
- What tools do you use to help debug a problem (i.e. console.log, debugger, something else?)
- How do you approach dealing with a bug?

## Main Problem

Pair up with at least one other classmate and work together on any problem you've had so far (this module, or sooner), that you've gotten stuck on. Try to follow the format:

- What am I working on?
- What is the code supposed to do?
- What is the code doing now?
  - If there is an error message, go through each line, some lines are helpful, some lines are not helpful.
  - Usually, errors have a `call stack` that is it lists where the error is, and all the other functions that were called in the process of generating that error.
  - Many of those files are part of an API/library - sometimes there is a bug in their code, usually it is a bug in your code.
    - If you are certain (after much testing and research) there is a problem with their code, you can go to their github and open an issue. [Here are the issues with express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues)
    - Here are their [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/06d11755c99fe4c1cddf8b889a687448b568472d/Contributing.md) - always read and abide by the contributor guidelines BEFORE submitting an issue
- What have I tried to do to fix it?
- Formulate one short question that addresses exactly what you are stuck on
