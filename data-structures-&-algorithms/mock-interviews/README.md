## Mock Interviews

During this module, instructors will conduct 3 mock interviews per student. This is what you will be evaluated on

- Ready to go: you have other programs closed, your screen is ready to share and you are ready to start the interview immediately
- Discussion question: these are based on the behavioral questions you have been learning and reviewing in the PBD/IR sessions
- Trivia question: Every lesson has a few trivia questions, one (or a very similar one) will be chosen from the list. This is to help you practice talking about code concepts
- Code Challenge: You will be given a code challenge. You should follow the problem solving methodologies you have been taught. It is important to demonstrate your problem solving skills and ability to talk about code.

## Peer to Peer Mock Interviews

In addition to having interviews with your instructors, you will have opportunities to practice interviewing each other. This will also help you gain understanding of what it feels like to be on the other side of the interview, which should help clarify what interviewers are often looking for.
