# Activity

## Planning a simple app

Think back to the [Veterinarian API](https://github.com/joinpursuit/resource-veterinarian-api) - use this app description as a reference to plan a new version of this app.

- Write out user stories and then put them into a new Trello board (you can delete this board once it has been graded)

## After the next lesson:

- Create 2 wireframes for 2 different views

- Create ERDs for the app, which, at minimum, should include: pets, owners, employees. Don't forget to use lines and symbols to denote their relationship to each other.

At the end of lab, get together with your instructors and classmates and go over how it went. How did it go? What were the challenges?
