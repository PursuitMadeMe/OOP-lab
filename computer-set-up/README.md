# Pursuit Core Environment Setup

Welcome to Pursuit! We can't wait to begin this journey with you. Before diving right into programming, it is important to first ready your tools. In this program, your key tool is going to be your computer.

At multiple points throughout this course, you will install a variety of programs and tools. You will also sign up for different free services. You will only install or sign up for what you need when you need it.

If an installation process doesn't work, reach out to an instructor for help.
